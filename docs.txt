Development Environment Setup
Python Version:

Ensure Python 3.6 or newer is installed on your system. You can check your Python version by running 

    ython --version or python3 --version in your terminal.

Virtual Environment (venv):

 Create a virtual environment to manage your project's dependencies separately. Navigate to your project directory and run:

    source venv/bin/activate


Install Dependencies:

     Ensure your requirements.txt file is up-to-date with all the necessary packages. Install them by running:

     pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Application Locally
Environment Variables:
    If your application uses environment variables (for API keys, configurations, etc.), make sure they are set up in your development environment. You can use a .env file or export them directly in your terminal.

Start the Flask Application:
    Navigate to your project directory and run the Flask application with:

        flask run

    Alternatively, if your entry file is named differently (e.g., app.py), you can run:

        python app.py

The application should now be running on http://localhost:5000. You can access it using your web browser or test it using tools like Postman.
